Installation:
1) install the gem
gem install sequel_acts_as_cacheable
2) specify the plugin in your sequel model
plugin :acts_as_cacheable, :cache => CACHE, :time_to_live => 60  (this is the time to live in seconds)

This plugin is able to utilize the caching provided by the memcache-client or dalli gems to automatically cache primary key lookups. Additionally, for more manual control the methods cache!, cached?, uncache!, and invalidate_cache! are also added to the sequel model.

If you want to customize the caching to lump extra data into the cache you can use the before_cache hook.

class Thing < Sequel::Model
    def heavy_computation
        @heavy_computation ||= ...
    end


    def before_cache
        heavy_computation
    end
end
